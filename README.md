Hello 😁😁, I'm Michael Adriel Darmawan, a computer science student in BINUS University.
Me, Nathanael William Boentoro, and Kevin Christian made this research paper to raise awareness regarding our concern about the current condition of flooding in Jakarta.
You can contact me in my email if you want to ask me a question or give some suggestions.
Thank you 👍
