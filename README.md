Hello 😁😁, I'm Michael Adriel Darmawan, a computer science student in BINUS University.<br><br>
Our team, William Boentoro, and Kevin Christian Surya, made this research paper to raise awareness regarding our concern about the current condition of flooding in Jakarta.<br><br>
You can contact us through my <a href="mailto: michaeladriel080801@gmail.com">email<a> if you want to ask me a question or give some suggestions.<br><br>
